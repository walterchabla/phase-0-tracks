# Release 0: Attempt a Tricky Algorithm
# a method that takes a spy's real name (e.g., "Felicia Torres") and creates a fake name with it

# a method that swaps names, method name:
# swap_name that takes one parameter(name)
# inside the method:
# name.split.rotate.join(" ")
# name is going to be split and return an array, then the array its going to be rotated last join then and that is going to give a string.
# output:
# name swaped

# a method that changes a vowel to the net vowel, method name:
# next_vowel that takes one parameter (vowels)
# inside the method:
# vowels.tr('aeiou', 'eioua')
# it will swith vowels to the next vowel
# output:
# vowels changed to the next vowel

# method that changes a consonant to next consonant, method name:
# next_consonant that takes a parameter (consonant)
# inside the method:
# consonant.tr('bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz', 'cdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzb')
# it will swith to the next consonant
# output:
# consonants changed to the next consonants

# a method that creates a fake name for the agent, method name:
# fake_agent_name, that takes a parameter (name)
# inside the method:
# using the other methods that wer created
# fake_name = next_consonant(next_vowel(swap_name(name)))
# puts fake_name
# output:
# creates a fake agent name with vowels and consonants change to the next letter and name swaped.
