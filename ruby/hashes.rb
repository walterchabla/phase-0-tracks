# A program that will allow an interior designer to enter the details of a given client: the client's name, age, has children, decor theme, which room?
# ask 5 questions for the designer or user about name, age, has children,decor theme and which room?
# store the answer:
# name = gets.chomp (use this gets.chompfor all questions, use different variables)
# if answer is equal to a symbol(key) ask for another answer and update the hash
# save their answer and put into a hash:
# declare a new hash with symbols and answers as values: applicant = {name: name, age: age, children: children, decor theme: theme, room: room}
# prints the hash with all the information
