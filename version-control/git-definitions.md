# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. It is useful because you compared an older version incase you want to fix a new version or see whats wrong. Also you keep track of changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  Branch is the a way to work on differents versions of a repository at one time. We use it so we can make changes, add things and to keep the 'original' branch clean just incase it did not work.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  Commit are saved changes. A good messege would be a good description explaning a particular change.

* What is a merge conflict?
  Merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file and they are merging together.
